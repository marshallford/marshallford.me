## About Me

I am a DevOps Engineer & Full Stack Web Developer from the snowy state of Minnesota. I have a wide array of interests in technology thanks to an appetite for learning and a hearty portion of curiosity (see what I did there?).

Within the sphere of operations and site reliability I am passionate about:

1. Adopting container orchestration as a secure and scalable landing zone for workloads
2. Building versatile developer-first platforms
3. Innovating with public cloud offerings
4. Embracing GitOps and Infrastructure as Code principles to describe and manage systems
5. Utilizing CI/CD tooling for transparent, predictable, and reliable builds

1. Developing intuitive and pragmatic front-ends
2. Implementing performant and secure back-ends, APIs, and services
3. Harnessing mature open source platforms for caching and persistence
